Components I used:
8 jumper wires
3 resistors
3 photoresistors
1 breadboard
1 arduino
1 arduino cable

This project is a arduino powered machine that uses photoresistors to
calibrate RGB colors so it can accurately detect colors, its lightness
and darkness. If anything is placed near these resitors, they try their
best to detect what color it is.

I had trouble coding this project for the most part, but I can say
I've learned enough to where I can work around it mistakes.

I chose this project because it seemed the most simpler thing to work
with, and at the same time, it being the most interactive and what people
would generally find interesting. I've had changes in ideas since most
of what I thought of earlier at the start of the project seemed
complex. Less is more.
